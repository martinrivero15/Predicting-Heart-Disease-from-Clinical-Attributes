# Predicting-Heart-Disease-from-Clinical-Attributes
This repository uses the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models that predict the presence of heart disease. We apply preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), classification models, hyperparameter tuning, and interpretability (SHAP).
